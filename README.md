Grunt-contrib-stylus(forked version) uses stylus#0.51.1
Local stylus is #0.51.0
 
Run 
* npm test
* node test
* grunt test
 
And then compare results

The only one which works properly is `npm test`, bot test.js uses the same version, it's strange.
As soon as local stylus is #0.52.0, node script works well
